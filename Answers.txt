EX1:
This program shows how a parent process can create a child process. When fork() runs:
the child process gets pid = 0 and prints its PID
the parent process gets the child’s PID (pid > 0) and prints its own PID
If fork() fails, it returns a negative value


EX2:
sleep 300 & runs the sleep command for 300 seconds in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal
jobs shows all currently running background processes


EX3:
ps aux | grep sleep finds the PID of the sleep process
kill <PID> stops the process completely
kill -STOP <PID> pauses it; kill -CONT <PID> resumes it


EX4:
kill -STOP <PID> Pause a process
kill -CONT <PID> Resume the process



EX5:
The linker connects separate .c files so functions in one file can be used in another
After compiling and linking, running the program prints: "Hello from file1!"


EX6:
The loader prepares the program for execution: it loads the executable into memory, sets up the stack/heap, and links required shared libraries
ldd shows which libraries the program uses dynamically at runtime


Linker Job:
Combining multiple object files into a single executable
Filling in memory addresses for all functions and variables
Making sure the program can run as one complete application


Loader Job:
Loading the executable into memory
Loading required shared libraries dynamically
Passing program arguments and starting execution at main()
